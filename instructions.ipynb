I took a deep breath. \"Okay, like I told Annabeth on the phone, something bad is going to \\nhappen by tonight. Some kind of trap. We\\'ve got to get an audience with Zeus and convince him to \\ndefend the city.

She\\'d known Luke better than anyone, of \\ncourse, but Connor looked away quickly. \"Um, I mean, it could be anybody.\" \"Yes.\" Katie Gardner frowned at the Stoll brothers. She\\'d disliked them ever since they\\'d \\ndecorated the grass roof of the Demeter cabin with chocolate Easter bunnies. \"Like one of Luke\\'s \\nsiblings.\" Travis and Connor both started arguing with her. \"Stop!\" Silena banged the table so hard her hot chocolate spilled. \"Charlie\\'s dead and . . . and you\\'re all arguing like little kids!\" She put her head down and began to sob. Hot chocolate trickled off the Ping-Pong table. Everybody looked ashamed. \"She\\'s right,\" Pollux said at last. \"Accusing each other doesn\\'t help. We need to keep our \\neyes open for a silver necklace with a scythe charm. If Kronos had one, the spy probably does too.\" Michael Yew grunted. \"We need to find this spy before we plan our next operation.'}\n",

Don\\'t you think your father knows what will happen to you?\" I was too stunned to answer. \"Perrrcy,\" Grover warned, \"he\\'s playing with your mind. Trying to make you angry.\" Grover could read emotions, so he probably knew Prometheus was succeeding. \"Do you really blame your friend Luke?\" the Titan asked me. \"And what about you, Percy? Will you be controlled by your fate? Kronos offers you a much better deal.\" I clenched my fists. As much as I hated what Prometheus had shown me, I hated Kronos a \\nlot more. \"I\\'ll give you a deal. Tell Kronos to call off his attack, leave Luke Castellan\\'s body, and \\nreturn to the pits of   Tartarus. Then maybe I won\\'t have to destroy him,\" \\nThe  empousa  snarled. Her hair erupted in fresh flames, but Prometheus just sighed. \"If you change your mind,\" he said, \"I have a gift for you.\" A Greek vase appeared on the table.'}\n",

    "# {'question': 'Who is Annabeth Chase?', 'answer': '\\nRick Riordan\\n ', 'context': 'No one else seemed to notice \\nher, but I realized maybe she preferred it that way. \"And now,\" Chiron said, \"early to bed! Remember, you must vacate your cabins by noon \\ntomorrow unless you\\'ve made arrangements to stay the year with us. The cleaning harpies will eat \\nany stragglers, and I\\'d hate to end the summer on a sour note!\" The next morning, Annabeth and I stood at the top of Half-Blood Hill. We watched the buses \\nand vans pull away, taking most of the campers back to the real world. A few old-timers would be \\nstaying behind, and a few of the newcomers, but I was heading back to Goode High School for my \\nRick Riordan\\n \\nThe Last Olympian - 05\\nsophomore year—the first time in my life I\\'d ever done two years at the same school. \"Good-bye,\" Rachel said to us as she shouldered her bag. She looked pretty nervous, but \\nshe was keeping a promise to her father and attending Clarion Academy in New Hampshire. It \\nwould be next summer before we got our Oracle back. \"You\\'ll do great.\" Annabeth hugged her.'}\n",

What they found were Annabeth, Grover, and me standing over the body of a broken halfblood, in the dim warm light of the hearth. \"Percy,\" my father called, awe in his voice. \"What . . . what is this?\" I turned and faced the Olympians. \"We need a shroud,\" I announced, my voice cracking. \"A shroud for the son of Hermes.\" 119 \\n119\\nChapter Twenty \\nWe Win Fabulous Prizes \\nThe Three Fates themselves took Luke\\'s body. I hadn\\'t seen the old ladies in years, since I\\'d witnessed them snip a life thread at a roadside \\nfruit stand when I was twelve. They\\'d scared me then, and they scared me now—three ghoulish \\ngrandmothers with bags of knitting needles and yarn. One of them looked at me, and even though she didn\\'t say anything, my life literally flashed \\nbefore my eyes. Suddenly I was twenty. Then I was a middle-aged man. Then I turned old and \\nwithered.'}\n",
    "# {'question': 'What camp does Percy attend?', 'answer': 'August', 'context': 'Grover nodded at Nico, then he gave me a big hug. He smelled like fresh-mown lawns.

    "# {'question': 'Who is Luke Castellan?', 'answer': 'Titan lord Kronos', 'context': 'He wore jeans, a white Tshirt, and flip-flops, like he was just a normal college-age guy, but his eyes told the truth. They were \\nsolid gold. \"We\\'ve been expecting you for days.\" At first he sounded normal, like Luke. But then his face \\ntwitched. A shudder passed through his body as though he\\'d just drunk something really nasty. His \\nvoice   became heavier, ancient, and powerful—the voice of the Titan lord Kronos. The words \\nscraped down my spine like a knife blade. \"Come, bow before me.\" \"Yeah, that\\'ll happen,\" I muttered. Laistrygonian giants filed in on either side of the swimming pool as if they\\'d been waiting for \\na cue. Each was eight feet tall with tattooed arms, leather armor, and spiked clubs. Demigod \\narchers appeared on the roof above Luke. Two hellhounds leaped down from the opposite balcony \\nand snarled at me. Within seconds I was surrounded. A trap: there\\'s no way they could\\'ve gotten \\ninto position so fast unless they\\'d known I was coming. I looked up at Luke, and anger boiled inside me.'}\n",
    "# {'question': 'What kind of creature is Grover?', 'answer': 'goat', 'context': 'Grover fell out of the branches, right on his \\nhead. \"Grover!\" I yelled. \"Woof!\" Mrs. O\\'Leary looked up, probably wondering if we were   going to play fetch with the \\nsatyr. \"Blah-haa-haa!\" Grover bleated. \"You okay, man?\" \"Oh, I\\'m fine.\" He rubbed his head. His horns had grown so much they poked an inch above \\nhis curly hair. \"I was at the other end of the park. The dryads had this great  idea of passing me \\nthrough the trees to get me here. They don\\'t understand  height  very well.\" He grinned and got to his feet—well, his  hooves,  actually. Since last summer, Grover had \\nstopped trying to disguise himself as human. He never wore a cap or fake feet anymore. He didn\\'t \\neven wear jeans, since he had furry goat legs from the waist down. His T-shirt had a picture from \\nthat book  Where the Wild Things Are. It was covered with dirt and tree sap. His goatee looked fuller, \\nalmost manly (or goatly? ), and he was as tall as me now. \"Good to see you, G-man,\" I said. \"You remember Nico.\"'}\n",
    "# {'question': 'Who is Clarisse La Rue?', 'answer': 'DRAKON-SLAYER', 'context': 'She was so inspiring, even the panicked centaurs started to rally. The Hunters scrounged \\narrows from the fallen and launched volley after volley into the enemy. The Ares cabin slashed and \\nhacked, which was their favorite thing. The monsters retreated toward 35th Street. Clarisse drove to the drakon\\'s carcass and looped a grappling line through its eye sockets. She lashed her horses and took off, dragging the drakon behind the chariot like a Chinese New \\nYear dragon. She charged after the enemy, yelling insults and daring them to cross her. As she \\nrode, I realized she was literally glowing. An aura of red fire flickered around her. \"The blessing of Ares,\" Thalia said. \"I\\'ve never seen it in person before.\" For the moment, Clarisse was as invincible as I was. The enemy threw spears and arrows, \\nbut nothing hit her. Rick Riordan \\nPercy Jackson and the Olympians \\n\"I AM CLARISSE, DRAKON-SLAYER!\" she yelled. \"I will kill you ALL! Where is Kronos? Bring him out! Is he a coward?\" \"Clarisse!\" I yelled. \"Stop it.'}\n",
    "# {'question': 'What does the Oracle of Delphi do?', 'answer': 'accept the spirit of Delphi', 'context': 'I accept the spirit of Delphi, Voice of the Gods, Speaker \\nof Riddles, Seer of Fate.\" I didn\\'t know where she was getting the words, but they flowed out of her as the Mist \\nthickened. A green column of smoke, like a huge python, uncoiled from the mummy\\'s mouth and \\nslithered down the stairs, curling affectionately around Rachel\\'s feet. The Oracle\\'s mummy \\ncrumbled, falling away until it was nothing but a pile of dust in an old tie-dyed dress. Mist enveloped \\nRachel in a column. For a moment I couldn\\'t see her at all. Then the smoke cleared. Rachel collapsed and curled into the fetal position. Annabeth, Nico, and I rushed forward, but \\nApollo said, \"Stop! This is the most delicate part.\" \"What\\'s going on?\" I demanded. \"What do you mean?\" Apollo studied Rachel with concern. \"Either the spirit takes hold, or it doesn\\'t.\" \"And if it doesn\\'t?\" Annabeth asked. \"Five syllables,\" Apollo said, counting them on his fingers. \"That would be real bad.\" Despite Apollo\\'s warning, I ran forward and knelt over Rachel.'}\n",
    "# {'question': 'Who is the leader of Camp Half-Blood?', 'answer': 'Chiron', 'context': 'The half-bloods will be in such disarray they will not be able to defend themselves. Go now, \\nEthan. Work on improving your memory. We will talk again when we have taken Manhattan.\" Ethan bowed, and my dreams shifted one last time. I saw   the Big House at camp, but it was \\na different era. The house was painted red instead of blue. The campers down at the volleyball pit \\nhad early \\'90s hairstyles, which were probably good for keeping monsters away. Chiron stood by the porch, talking to Hermes and a woman holding a baby. Chiron\\'s hair was \\nshorter and darker. Hermes wore his usual jogging suit with his winged high-tops. The woman was \\ntall and pretty. She had blond hair, shining eyes and a friendly smile. The baby in her arms squirmed \\nin his blue blanket like Camp Half-Blood was the last place he wanted to be. \"It\\'s an honor to have you here,\" Chiron told the woman, though he sounded nervous. \"It\\'s \\nbeen a long time since a mortal was allowed at camp.\" \"Don\\'t encourage her,\" Hermes grumbled.'}\n",
    "# {'question': 'What is the prophecy about Percy?', 'answer': '\\nprophecy', 'context': 'In horse form, his head almost brushed \\nthe lights in the rec room. \"You see now, Percy, why we thought it best not to tell you the whole \\nprophecy. You\\'ve had enough on your shoulders—\" \\n\"Without realizing I was going to die in the end anyway?\" I said. \"Yeah, I get it.\" Chiron gazed at me sadly. The guy was three thousand years old. He\\'d seen hundreds of \\nheroes die. He might not like it, but he was used to it. He probably knew better than to try to \\nreassure me. \"Percy,\" Annabeth said. \"You know prophecies always have double meanings. It might not \\n19 \\nliterally mean you die.\" 19\\n\"Sure,\" I said. \"A single choice shall end his days. That has tons of meanings, right?\" \"Maybe we can stop it,\" Jake Mason offered. \"The hero\\'s soul, cursed blade shall reap. Maybe we could find this cursed blade and destroy it. Sounds like Kronos\\'s scythe, right?\" I hadn\\'t thought about that, but it didn\\'t matter if the cursed blade was Riptide or Kronos\\'s \\nscythe. Either way, I doubted we could stop the prophecy.'}\n",
    "# {'question': 'What is the name of Percy’s mother?', 'answer': 'Sally', 'context': 'She \\ndidn\\'t need to know that I was probably doomed. I could only hope I\\'d stop Kronos and save the rest \\nof the world before I died. \"You\\'re my son,\" she said miserably. \"I can\\'t just . . .\" I could tell I\\'d have to push her harder if I wanted her to agree, but I didn\\'t want to. I \\nremembered poor Ms. Castellan in her kitchen, waiting for her son to come home. And I realized \\nhow lucky I was. My mom had always been there for me, always tried to make things normal for me, \\n Rick Riordan \\nPercy Jackson and the Olympians \\neven with the gods and monsters and stuff. She put up with me going off on adventures, but now I \\nwas asking her blessing to do something that would probably get me killed. I locked eyes with Paul, and some kind of understanding passed between us. \"Sally.\" He put his hand over my mother\\'s hands. \"I can\\'t claim to know what you and Percy \\nhave been going through all these years. But it sounds to me . . . it sounds like Percy is doing \\nsomething noble. I wish I had that much courage.\"'}\n",
    "# {'question': 'Who is Chiron?', 'answer': 'Thalia', 'context': 'Chiron\\'s face darkened. \"The gods are tiring. Dionysus was incapacitated yesterday. Typhon \\nRick Riordan\\n \\nThe Last Olympian - 05\\nsmashed his chariot, and the wine god went down somewhere m the Appalachians. No one has \\nseen him since. Hephaestus is out of action as well.
